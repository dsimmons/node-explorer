# node-explorer

This is basically a light-weight file server built using Node, MongoDB, Express, and Backbone.js for MVC. Authentication will eventually be supported via sessions, and it will support multiple users of varying permissions (and the interface should update accordingly). 

## Disclaimer

I intend to open source the core of this server.  I intend to add additional private functionality, but it should be easily extendable to any case.
